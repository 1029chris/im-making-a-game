# I'm Making a Game!
I'm learning to code a game with Love2D. I hope it goes well! I haven't done much yet, much more work needs to be done! Like I said, I'm still learning! This will probably be buggy. I'm not sure if this project will go anywhere, but it will be a great learning experience!

To use this, you will need to get the love2d framework, available [here!](https://love2d.org/) After installation, execute this code by dragging the game folder onto the LOVE icon.
